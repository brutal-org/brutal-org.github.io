It's been a long time, 450 commits to be precise but we are back with a new milestone of the BRUTAL operating system! This one was focused on the desktop side of things, but also on improving our IPC framework.

## New Website

First, we rebuild the website from scratch! with improved redabilty and layout using the following tech stack:

- nextjs
- tailwindcss
- mdx

You might think this is a bit overkill for a simple blog, but we have big plan for the future ;)

## Improved IPC and IDL

Next, our IPC framework got a big everhault this release with support for:

- Attributes
- Improved user defined types
- Modules

Here is an exemple of an IPC module:

```
module event;

import base, math;
include brutal/ui.h;

type Event = __ctype(UiEvent);

interface Sink
{
    method dispatch Event -> Bool;
};
```


```json
{
    "name": "ps2",
    "consume": ["system.Server", "event.Sink"],
    "rights": ["irq", "pio", "log"]
}
```

## Graphic Library

After that, we built a full graphic library featuring vector graphics, bitmap graphics, and a lot of other stuff.

## Widget Library

Based on the new IPC framework and the new graphic library, we built a new widget library.

(NOTE: this is using our builtin fallback font since we don't have filesystem support yet)

## General Improvements

- Improved stability
- Tons of library improvements

## What's Next

Milestone 5 will focus on building the storage stack, and improve the stability of the system.

This roadmap is not set in stone, and is subject to changes. You might want to check out the <a href="https://github.com/brutal-org/brutal/blob/main/meta/roadmap.md">latest version of the roadmap</a>.
